# HexAI
Implemented Alpha-Beta Minimax search along with Two-Distance Pruning and a Resistance-based board evaluation function to play Hex. Two-Distance Pruning helps select the top moves from a given board position, eliminating the need to explore all moves during Minimax search. Furthermore, the Resistance-based board evaluation function is a highly effective heuristic which allows the Minimax algorithm to score intermediate board states.

The following research papers were used for help with developing the agent:
